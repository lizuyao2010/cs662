This is the folder of our quesiton generation project
run the command:
cd practNLPTools-1.0
To check the system performance just run the command:
    ./demo.sh
    It will test the input file Broken-origInputOnlySent.txt in the practNLPTools-1.0/data folder and output the question generation results file Broken-origInputOnlySent.txt.out in the newInput folder.
    To evaluate the result file Broken-origInputOnlySent.txt.out
    You need to run commands:
    cd ../newInput
    ./evaluate.sh
    It will give you the accuracy of our question generation system.
You can also play with the system by run the command:
    echo 'your input sentence' | ./demo.py
    it will print out four lines for each quesiton type
    the first line is your input sentence
    the second line is the question generated
    the third line is the answer generated
    the fourth line is question type
